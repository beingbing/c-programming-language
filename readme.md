this repository contains all the programs in c made by me whose statements are present in book-

## The C Programming Language. by- "Brian W. Kernighan" and "Dennis M. Ritchie"

Note:

I have left out chapter 8 as it is not necessary for in todays day and age to know in detail
about languages this close to the machine.

If you are sitting in third decade of 21st century, then don't make mistake of picking this
book like me, go straight for latest versions of c++ stl of better go for python.
